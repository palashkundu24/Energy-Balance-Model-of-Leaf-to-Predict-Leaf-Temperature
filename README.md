# Description: 
# This repository contains files and code for energy balance model of leaf to predict the canopy temperature. This repository is created for the semester project of SOIL 6583 : Soil Physics with Python course.
# Energy Balance: The energy balance model allows an estimation of energy loss by transpiration, 
# which is dependent on the gradient of water vapour from the leaf to the atmosphere and the total conductance to water vapour (gtw, the ease with which water vapour diffuses through stomatal pores and the boundary layer).
